Revision history for Perl extension Path::Class.

0.06  Fri Mar 26 22:20:32 CST 2004

 - Added documentation for $dir->next(), which was for some reason
   missing.

 - Simplified a little internal code in $dir->next().

 - Added the slurp(), openr(), and openw() methods to
   Path::Class::File.

 - Added a parent() method to Path::Class::File, which helps in those
   cases where the distinction between a file and a directory isn't
   significant. [Paul Hoffman]

 - Added a basename() method to Path::Class::File. [Richard Evans]

0.04  Thu Jan  1 22:47:18 CST 2004

 - Added several useful methods for interacting with the filesystem,
   such as $file->open(), or $dir->mkpath().

 - file() and dir() are now exported by default when loading
   Path::Class. [Michael Schwern]

 - Fixed a problem that happened when interacting with the File::Spec
   that comes with perl 5.6.0.  Names weren't being stringified
   properly. [Michael Schwern]

 - Fixed a test failure on Win32 (from line 71 of t/01-basic.t).
   [reported by Murat Ünalan]

 - Rewrote general description of Path::Class in the documentation
   [suggested by Joshua Keroes]

 - D'oh!  Forgot to add the t/02-foreign.t test to the MANIFEST.

 - The way I was faking out File::Spec to pretend it's on a Unix
   system during testing wasn't working.  [Reported by DH]

0.02  Tue Jul  8 14:51:24 CDT 2003

 - Added the capability to work with paths from other systems, see
   'foreign' in the docs.

 - Now depends on File::Spec::Mac 1.3, since 1.2 was pretty broken.

 - relative() and absolute() methods can now take an optional argument
   to use as the base of relativity.
