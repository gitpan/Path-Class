Revision history for Perl extension Path::Class.

0.10  Wed Apr  6 17:04:45 CDT 2005

 - Fixed a bug in relative() that would ignore the optional argument
   if the given file/dir was already specified as relative.

 - Fixed a typo in the documentation - I wrote Path::Class::mkdir()
   and Path::Class::rmtree() where I meant File::Path::mkdir() and
   File::Path::rmtree().

0.09  Tue Apr  5 20:42:20 CDT 2005

 - Added the dir_list() method, which gives the user direct access to
   the list of directories that makes up a Path::Class::Dir object
   (NEEDS DOCUMENTATION). [Suggested by Smylers]

 - Documented the behavior of $dir->next() when the directory doesn't
   exist or is unreadable (it dies). [Smylers]

 - Fixed a bug that could result in extra backslashes between the
   volume and path (such as C:\\Foo\Bar). [Smylers]

 - Added the is_dir() method, which is a simple way to tell the
   difference between a file and a directory. [Suggested by Smylers]

0.08  Tue Dec 28 08:26:56 CST 2004

 - Fixed a typo in the module name in the docs. [Chris Dolan]

 - Added a copyright statement to the docs, for some reason it was
   missing. [Spotted by Chris Dolan]

0.07  Wed Jun 30 15:31:35 CDT 2004

 - Fixed a bug in dir("foo/")->parent and
   file("foo/bar")->dir. [Spotted by Sterling Hanenkamp]

0.06  Fri Mar 26 22:20:32 CST 2004

 - Added documentation for $dir->next(), which was for some reason
   missing.

 - Simplified a little internal code in $dir->next().

 - Added the slurp(), openr(), and openw() methods to
   Path::Class::File.

0.05  Mon Jan 19 22:36:29 CST 2004

 - Added a parent() method to Path::Class::File, which helps in those
   cases where the distinction between a file and a directory isn't
   significant. [Paul Hoffman]

 - Added a basename() method to Path::Class::File. [Richard Evans]

0.04  Thu Jan  1 22:47:18 CST 2004

 - Added several useful methods for interacting with the filesystem,
   such as $file->open(), or $dir->mkpath().

 - file() and dir() are now exported by default when loading
   Path::Class. [Michael Schwern]

 - Fixed a problem that happened when interacting with the File::Spec
   that comes with perl 5.6.0.  Names weren't being stringified
   properly. [Michael Schwern]

 - Fixed a test failure on Win32 (from line 71 of t/01-basic.t).
   [reported by Murat Ünalan]

 - Rewrote general description of Path::Class in the documentation
   [suggested by Joshua Keroes]

0.03  Wed Jul  9 09:32:52 CDT 2003

 - D'oh!  Forgot to add the t/02-foreign.t test to the MANIFEST.

 - The way I was faking out File::Spec to pretend it's on a Unix
   system during testing wasn't working.  [Reported by DH]

0.02  Tue Jul  8 14:51:24 CDT 2003

 - Added the capability to work with paths from other systems, see
   'foreign' in the docs.

 - Now depends on File::Spec::Mac 1.3, since 1.2 was pretty broken.

 - relative() and absolute() methods can now take an optional argument
   to use as the base of relativity.

0.01  Wed Mar 12 18:17:04 CST 2003

 - original version; created by h2xs 1.21 with options
   -XA -n Path::Class
