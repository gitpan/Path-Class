Revision history for Perl extension Path::Class.

 - D'oh!  Forgot to add the t/02-foreign.t test to the MANIFEST.

 - The way I was faking out File::Spec to pretend it's on a Unix
   system during testing wasn't working.  [Reported by DH]

 - Added the capability to work with paths from other systems, see
   'foreign' in the docs.

 - Now depends on File::Spec::Mac 1.3, since 1.2 was pretty broken.

 - relative() and absolute() methods can now take an optional argument
   to use as the base of relativity.
